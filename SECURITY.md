## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a potential vulnerability or exploit in this repository — whether related to data privacy, software logic, or infrastructure — please report it responsibly.

**To report a security issue:**
- Email: security@livelab.network (or your preferred contact)
- Do **not** open public GitHub issues for sensitive disclosures
- Provide a clear description, steps to reproduce (if applicable), and suggested mitigations

We aim to respond within **5 business days**.

## Scope

This repository contains experimental code, ideas, and protocols related to decentralized data monetization, smart housing infrastructure, and AI-integrated systems.

**Important Notes:**
- This is pre-production software. Use at your own risk.
- No guarantee of full cybersecurity compliance (e.g. OWASP, SOC 2, etc.) at this stage.
- Contributors are expected to follow secure coding practices and avoid introducing malicious dependencies.

## Guiding Principles

- **Privacy-first by design**: All data flows should be opt-in, transparent, and encryptable.
- **No hidden surveillance**: All tracking systems must be user-visible and consent-based.
- **Modular permissions**: System components should be sandboxed and auditable.
- **Community defense**: Report abuses or backdoors immediately.

## Dependencies

A full list of current dependencies (if applicable) will be maintained in the `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or equivalent file. Use trusted, actively maintained libraries wherever possible.

---

## Future Improvements

Planned security upgrades may include:
- User-level data vaults
- Zero-knowledge proof integrations
- Secure API tokens with scoped access
- Automated security auditing (via Dependabot or others)
