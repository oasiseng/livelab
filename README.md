# 🧠 Live Lab Housing Protocol™  
*Turn your house into a platform. Trade data for rent relief. Build the future of human-AI symbiosis.*

![Live Lab Banner](banner-image-placeholder.png)

## 🚀 Overview

The **Live Lab Housing Protocol** is an open-source framework that reimagines the economics of housing by monetizing **opt-in human behavior data** collected through **smart homes, wearables, voice assistants, and IoT sensors**.

Instead of paying full rent or mortgage, residents contribute data — securely and transparently — to fund their homes.  
It’s housing… powered by attention, behavior, and biological insight.

Built at the intersection of:
- 🧠 AI fine-tuning  
- 💡 Smart homes & IoT  
- ⚖️ Data ethics & privacy  
- 🏠 Modular housing systems  
- 🌍 Economic reprogramming  

## 💡 Core Idea

Your environment collects valuable data 24/7.

Big Tech takes it for free.  
**We say: no more.**

With the Live Lab Protocol, we flip the model:

| **You provide** | **You receive** |
|------------------|------------------|
| Voice commands, sleep data, lighting behavior, appliance use, streaming habits, etc. | Monthly rent offset ($125–$275/mo value) |
| Participation in studies or feedback loops | Cash-equivalent tokens, discounts, platform access |
| Consent-based long-term behavior tracking | Home equity, stability, better housing access |

This protocol enables **data-for-housing exchanges**, tracked via smart contracts, data dashboards, and public APIs.

## 🔍 Use Cases

- **Affordable Housing** → Use data monetization to offset monthly rent
- **Modular Home Developers** → Offer homes with built-in revenue models
- **AI Labs** → Access high-quality real-world human behavior data
- **Researchers** → Secure, longitudinal opt-in datasets
- **Policy Pilots** → Launch Universal Basic Housing experiments

## 🧪 What’s in the Repo

| Folder | Contents |

## 📢 Join the Movement

We're building this out **in public**. If you're:
- An engineer with smart home or IoT chops  
- A builder or prefab housing developer  
- A researcher in AI ethics or behavior modeling  
- A privacy nerd who wants to architect safer systems  
- A policymaker curious about UBI or post-capitalist models  

— then we want you on this journey.
